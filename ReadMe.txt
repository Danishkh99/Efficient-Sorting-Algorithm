Data Structure Project:
=======================
A project that was assigned by Our course teacher.
I did this project from coursera
# Using Efficient Sorting Algorithms in Java to Arrange Tax Data
Language Used: Java
================================================================
In this projecct, we use different sorting algorithms t sort data. In this project we were introduced with 5
different sorting algorithms.
1) Bubble Sort
2) Insertion Sort
3) Selection Sort
4) Merge Sort
5) Quick Sort

In this project we arrange the sales tax of a country Misouri. And sort them by these five sorting algorithms.
We define time complexity as well as space complexities of these algorithms for finding the efficient one.

You can see our video description of this project and also I have uploaded this project on github.
So you can just copy this link and paste it on any browser for detailed description and the code.

# Direction to run
==================
You can run this project on any of the IDE of java. You can download the code files from above mentioned Github
link. You can also run this project by command promp CMD.

# Running through CMD
First you have to go to the folder where you saved those code files by using cmd keywords.
Once you approach there and there are java files.
for compiling write javac (the code file you want to run).java
for runing write java (the java code file you want to run)

# Runinig throgh Eclipse or Netbeans
As I said, you can run this project through any Java IDE.
Here I came up with these two. First you download the project from github link
and then just import it in any of the above mentioned IDE of java. And run it you will get the output.

In the output you will also see the time each sorting algorithm took for sorting.
And by noticing it you can comapre them with eachother.
